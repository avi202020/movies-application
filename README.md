# AngularApp

This is Angular 10 demo project which is based on Angular starter project https://angular.io/start  
The most challenging part for me was [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/), spent quite much time on reading docs  
and learning reactive states for immutable data handling, it works well.



## Project init

Run `npm i`

## Development

Run `ng serve`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project.

## Unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## End-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
